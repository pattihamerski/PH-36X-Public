    "Functions are used in almost every chunk of code, and even before we learned how to *declare* them, we were already *calling* functions for many different purposes (for example, `print`, `append`, `range`, `type`, `np.arange`). Being able to create a sequence of numbers is so much easier when we can quickly conjure them up with a command like `range(100)`, instead of creating a list or array from scratch and adding numbers in manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a function like that is called **calling** a function. This is how we tell the computer to execute function code. Otherwise, the function would exist only as a chunk of code, never executed. The syntax for calling a function goes like `function_name(value1, value2, ...)`, where each argument must be an **existing value** that the computer can plug in when executing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling a function, we only need to know **the function name, the values we want give as arguments, and the format to expect for the output.** For example, when calling the `range` function, we need to provide certain values such as the end of the range, and we can expect it to output a sequence of integers. We don't need to know the implementation of how `range` converts the arguments into the output -- it might as well be a black box. "
