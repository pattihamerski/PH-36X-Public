    "To compute probability from a histogram, for example, **the probability of selecting a simulation from a sample of 500 with energy between -0.4 and -0.375**, can be done by adding up numbers. The height of each little shaded bar indicates the number of simulations in that skinny range of energies. Adding up the heights of **all five bars shaded below** gets you the number of simulations (74) in the entire range of -0.4 to -0.375. Adding up the heights of **every bar** in the histogram gets you 500, which is the entire sample size. The probabibility, then, is given by $74/500 = 14.8\\%$.\n",
